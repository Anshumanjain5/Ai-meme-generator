Hey future Anshuman! Iâ€™ve done the task of the JSON converter. Now you have to create a function in the `utils` folder to place text in a specific rectangle area's coordinates. Then, in the components section, you need to create a function that takes the JSON list and places each specific text in its designated area in the correct order.
